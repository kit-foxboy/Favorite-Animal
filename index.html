    <h1>Why so Foxy?</h1>

        Foxes are my favorite animal for several reasons. Most concisely, I'll put it in the terms of a little girl at the zoo: "Look at the orange kittydogs!"
        They are definitely canids but have a lot of graceful and cleaver characteristics that we associate with cats. 
        They are highly agile, often springing themselves high to pounce on prey, but still exhibit a dog-like demeanor.
        They live on pretty much every continent and have displayed intelligence in quickly adapting to urban enviorments.

        In the end, their beauty is the most captivating. From pointy noses with wide ears to the pretty brush tails that often set them apart from other canids in size and color.
        Foxes are heavily depicted in media and can be seen anywhere from video games to advertising mascots. Their reputation for cleverness makes them popular symbols for wisdom or guile.
